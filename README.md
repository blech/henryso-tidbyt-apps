## date_and_time.star - Big-Number Clock With Date

[![date_and_time.star sample](img/date_and_time.gif)](date_and_time.star)

The official clock app is too small for my liking, so I created this one with
larger numbers.  It also shows the current date below.  Colors are configurable
via parameters.  See the file for more details.

## day_night_map.star - Day & Night World Map

[![day_night_map.star sample](img/day_night_map.gif)](day_night_map.star)

Displays the world map shaded to show day and night.  It can optionally show a
time and/or date overlay.  The map image is a down-scaled version of
[Equirectangular (0°) by Tobias Jung](https://map-projections.net/single-view/rectang-0:flat-stf)

## digital_rain.star - Digital Rain à la The Matrix

[![digital_rain.star sample](img/digital_rain.gif)](digital_rain.star)

What modern device doesn't have some implementation of the "digital rain" from
*The Matrix*.  My version employs symbols similar to the ones from the movie,
redrawn to a lower resolution.  Some symbols (like the period, double quotes,
and underscore) are omitted because they cause odd-looking gaps when not fully
visible.  The algorithm is based on a pseudo-random number generator and will
generate a new sequence every thirty minutes.
